# RentAppClassDiagram

This project is a renting application where users can rent different types of buildings such as apartments, houses, and shops. Each building has essential attributes like address, name, and size. Customers can rent as many buildings as they want. A contract is generated between the customer and the building owner, specifying details such as the rental period, price, and other important data. Payments can be made using PayPal, Visa, or MasterCard.
